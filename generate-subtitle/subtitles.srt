00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, I'm curious. Here's my little paper.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
If you need to relax but you don't have much time,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
this is the gift for you.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today I'm going to surprise you 30 curiosities

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
that you surely didn't know.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's been five minutes.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The wings of the moon will remain intact

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
during the millions of years

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
because the moon is not wind.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The dolphins are called the ones

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
because it's the one cause an unknown

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
of each other.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
A normal and direct basin

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
like this ruling here

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
can pesos two thousand kilos

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
with the powder and leaves that seemâ€¦

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You knew...

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the goats have better friends

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and they make a lot of stress if they separate themselves.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
One day you come to the palace

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
A year or less.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Do you know why?

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If you know, leave me in the comments.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The combination of possible combinations in the game of the G3 is greater than the number of atoms that exist in the observable universe.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You have realized that the fire does not have shadows.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The hot water is getting faster than cold water.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It is a phenomenon known as the effect in the dark.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The crocodiles and chimneys can enter stones to get more deeply into the water.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You know that the gold is edible.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The antichrist and hypids consume in the form of salt and elegance.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The giant chino is not edible, but it is a myth.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The Romans use urine to wash the clothes.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It can be a disgusting thing, but it contains ammonia, which is a very powerful and unpleasant desegra.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The powerful is the death of the azules.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This must be in the way the light disperses through the ocean atmosphere that is full of red fire.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You know that the whales are active.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
They form six months before they do.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The white butterfly has only 12 letters.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
5 vowels to EO and only 7 consonants.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The red earth is called Petricor, but you already knew it.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You saw this video.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You would have to be the strongest muscle of a human body in proportion to its size.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It is the language.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:10,000
In the medieval era, in addition to the second and the second, they had the moment, a unit of time that equivalent to 90 seconds.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You know that the babies have 100 bones around them, more than the adults.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The tygurons are older than the trees and the dinosaurs.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
They take here from the age of 450 million years old.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The tygurons originally were purple.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You have seen that the Mona Lisa has no cemeteries or pettines.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The colibrius have the most large cerebrus inside all the birds, in proportion to their size.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
They are incredibly intelligent.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The cats and the dogs, like the humans, can be furbues or disasters.

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You like the smell of the earth and the short beard.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Because the reality is an exile signal from the plant.

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It also serves to warn the danger to the rest of the plants.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The favorite color of most of the people, according to the studies and surveys, is the blue.

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Maybe because it is associated with things as a sky or sea in calm.

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You know that the national animal of the cow is the unicorn.

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But it is a small country in the corner of the limelight that measures its development through the national happiness of the fruit.

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It is instead a product of the fruit interior.

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You know that the statue of freedom works as a lighthouse for 16 years.

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Its entour was ascended and the ships that arrived at the port of New York.

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The pyramids of Egypt, when they were built, were dressed in white stone.

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Of the images, they would be like jewels that the plants under the sun of the desert.

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What a curiosity! I have found you more incredible!

66
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Leave me in the comments.

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000

The dolphins are called the ones

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
because one of them is a named

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,000
full of

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:51,000
innate undying.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Most of the seconds have one.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
A day is longer than a year is longer.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You know why?

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If you know, leave me in the comments.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:14,000

The Romans used urine to wash the clothes.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You can smell the light, but it contains ammonia, which is a very powerful degreasing.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The sea poses to bring up the waves.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This must be the way the light spreads through the ocean atmosphere, which is full of red earth dust.

31

You know that the waves are active.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
They form six months before making it.

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The hats and the feathers, whatever the humans can be fur or objects.

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You like the smell of the earth covered with silver.

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It is a sign of the oxylius of the plant.

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It also serves to warn the danger to the rest of the plants.

51

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Instead, he produced an interior fruit.

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You know that the statue of freedom works as a lighthouse for 16 years.

57

60
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Curiousness has appeared more incredible.
